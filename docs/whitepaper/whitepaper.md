# Nectar Whitepaper

Whitepaper Version 0.1

Summary: Nectar MEV Marketplace flips the script on MEV extraction, and redirects profit accrual from validators to themselves users.

> This whitepaper is “step two” of learning about Nectar. A good place to begin is our product-focused Pitch Deck including a demo video, and for a very detailed, in-depth and technical look into our product we have Documentation website.

Learning about Nectar:

0. **Video intro:** idea, user experience and benefits. 1 minute. Coming soon.
1. **Product pitch deck:** product introduction, strategy and market. 15 minutes.
   1. **Investment pitch deck:** with additional slides about seed round investing
2. **Whitepaper:** reasoning, building blocks and technical overview. You are here. 30 minutes.
3. **Documentation:** in-depth look into theory, implementation, development targets. 2 hours.

## In Brief

At Nectar Cash, we are building a way for users to get paid rewards just for using the blockchain normally. After setting up Nectar in their wallets, users can continue using their favorite web3 dapps. For each transaction, Nectar will figure out if there are any financial opportunities created by the user’s actions, and will make sure that the value of these opportunities gets returned to the user as a redeemable reward.

Behind the scenes Nectar is powered by intelligent transaction filtering, private transaction pool and maximal extractable value (MEV) auction. By analysing the transaction before it is announced publicly to the network, Nectar can identify potentially profitable transactions, and run the auction between bots using different strategies. Collected rewards are regularly paid out to users via smart contract deposits.

Nectar can be adopted by the users manually (by adjusting wallet settings) or via wallet partnerships. Overall MEV volume was over $400M during 2021. This estimate is undercounted, possibly by a large margin, as identifying all strategies is technically challenging and the category is quite broad.

## What is MEV?

- History
- PfoF for web3
- Strategies and players
- Rewarding validators
- Size
- Future

## How to protect yourself against MEV?

- Private mempools
- MEV-safe dapps, protocols and rollups
- Educate and adjust behavior
- or, just used our MEV marketplace

## MEV Marketplace

- rewards for using the blockchain
- auctioning off for your benefit
- very easy to adopt
- rewards collected automatically
- universal MEV protection
- profit / monetization opportunity for wallets, nodes, us

## How it works

Summary of flows

## Technical Implementation

More details in our documentaiton

- capturing raw transaction
- timed auction between searchers for unsigned transactions
- bundles submitted via standard searcher api
- rewards counted in smart contract

## Participant Incentives

- users
- wallets
- searchers
- block builders
- validators
- us / token holders

## Decentralization

- more over time
- multiple transaction collection points, including run by wallets themselves
- multiple auction houses, with unique searchers or different searcher relationships
- accounting can be fully autonomous

## Token and Airdrop

- decentralization introduces a couple of trust points
- these can be developed into verifiable data exchanges
- system using token to manage trust relationships via staking
- we can also onboard users with most MEV extracted from them via airdrop
- token could also allow staking to increase trust of a specific auction house or transaction pool, receiving revenue split

## Market Opportunity

40M / year in profit.
