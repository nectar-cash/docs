# What is MEV?

MEV was originally abbreviation of Miner Extractable Value, but with the move to Proof of Stake it has been renamed to Maximal Extractable Value.

MEV encompasses all financial opportunities that arise from transactions on the blockchain. From arbitrage to liquidations, bots can discover ways to extract value from the state of the blockchain before or after a certain transaction happens. The transaction might be a swap, an oracle update, change in liquidity or something else. MEV is a fairly generic concept and is constantly evolving, with new opportunities created by new DeFi protocols or other innovations on the blockchain. 

Value extraction is performed by bots called Searchers. Searchers tend to specialize into one type of MEV, and optimize themselves to be as efficient as possible. Searchers can operate on public mempools (list of yet-unconfirmed transactions) or private protocols.

Currently almost all MEV efforts are for the benefit of miners
